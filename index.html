                <h1>Hi There</h1>
                <h2 id="name-title">I'm Thorben</h2>
                <h3 id="profession">a 2nd year media computer science student</h2>
                <p class="about-me-text">I currently study in Mittweida, a small town in Saxony, Germany, with a population of around 14,500. While many people I know don’t particularly enjoy living in such a small place, I’ve grown quite fond of it. Admittedly, there isn’t much going on here, but that’s precisely what I like about it. I love taking walks through the fields, soaking in the tranquility and enjoying the peacefulness of the surroundings. Most of the time, I hardly encounter anyone during my walks, which I find very refreshing.
                    That does not mean, that I do not like spending time with friends though. I do so quite often. Over the past year and a half of living and studying here, I’ve had the chance to meet some truly amazing people. When I’m not with them, I like to immerse myself in hobbies like photography. Though I’m still a beginner, I’m thoroughly enjoying the process of learning and experimenting. I also have a passion for sports and often find myself listening to German hip-hop—it’s my go-to genre.
                    As you might have guessed, I’m also interested in web development. I started learning it just a few weeks ago, and while I’m far from being an expert, I’m making steady progress—and that’s everything that matters.</p>
                <p class="about-me-text"><br>Thank you for taking the time to read this! I hope you’re doing well and I wish you all the best.</p>

            <p>
                Graph Scape is an educational game, which aims to help you understand path search algorithms in directed graphs better. It is a sandbox game in which you build the world yourself with hex fields and walk the most cost-effective path with your character between a start field and an end field. It is still in development.

                iManJuri is a cooperation project with domeba GmbH. We are a group of 8 Bachelor and 6 Master Students working on this project until summer next year. Until then I can not tell you much about the actual project but it has got to do with laws.
